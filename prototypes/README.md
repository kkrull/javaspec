# JavaSpec Prototypes

This is a collection of assorted ideas that have at some point been considered
for use in JavaSpec.

Code attempts to be self-contained as much as is practical, so as to focus on
evaluating one idea at a time.  That doesn't always happen in practice.  You
have to be able to get JUnit to recognize your tests before you can try new
syntactic forms for delcaring them, for example.
