Feature: Console Runner
  As a developer who is working on some code that is covered by specs
  In order to know which specs are running, passing, and failing as well as how they are failing
  I want to run specs on the command line and see a text report of specs and their results

  As a developer who is working on JavaSpec
  In order to observe side effects such as which specs have been run
  I want to run some acceptance tests from the same JVM process as JavaSpec

  Scenario: A ConsoleRunner should run specs and tell you what happened
    Given I have a JavaSpec runner for the console
    And I have a Java class that defines a suite of lambda specs
    When I run the specs in that class
    Then The runner should run the specs defined in that class
    And The runner should indicate which specs passed and failed
    And The runner should indicate whether any specs failed
