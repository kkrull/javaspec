/**
 * The JavaSpec syntax used to write and organize specs. The JavaSpec Engine
 * provides an instance of this to you when you implement {@link SpecClass}.
 * <p>
 * Use this as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Start with a top-level {@link #describe} block to identify your test
 * subject (usually a class object or a class name).</li>
 * <li>(Optional) Add another {@link #describe} block inside of that, with the
 * name of the method you are testing.</li>
 * <li>Add {@link #it} blocks inside of that, for each behavior that you want to
 * describe and verify. Use {@link #pending} instead of {@link #it} when you are
 * not ready to write the test procedure yet.</li>
 * <li>Add more {@link #describe} blocks to test more methods in the same
 * class.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * public void declareSpecs(JavaSpec javaspec) {
 *  javaspec.describe(Greeter.class, () -> { //Step 1
 *    javaspec.describe("#greet", () -> { //Step 2 (Optional)
 *      javaspec.it("greets the world, given no name", () -> { //Step 3
